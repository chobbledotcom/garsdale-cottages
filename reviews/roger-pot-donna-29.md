Warm welcome with the wood burner lit and an exceptional welcome pack. Cannot fault. We have an anxious mutt who is wary of large dogs and strangers but the hosts were understanding of this and ensured their (very friendly!) pooch was kept away from him. This made for a relaxing stay and for this we are grateful. The cottage is well equipped and very comfortable-slept really well! Location great for exploring the Dales and Lake District.All in all we had a lovely week- thank you!
