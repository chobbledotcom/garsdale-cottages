We all felt at home as soon as we stepped through the door. Credit to the owners, who put real effort into decorating for Christmas and ensuring that we had everything we needed, including fuel for the fire. This house is beautiful. It has a warm, welcoming, cosy feeling to it with a truly huge view across the valley. We could not have asked for more. It might be worth mentioning that the house is accessed via a narrow steep track with quite a steep drop to the river on one side, so you need to be a confident driver to negotiate it (my other half wouldn’t drive whilst we were here)
