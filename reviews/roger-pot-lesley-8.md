The accommodation was excellent and provided a high level of comfort after long days sightseeing. The rooms were capacious and facilities more than adequate. The place was spotless and the bed linen of high quality. Paul and Karen were very helpful when required but not intrusive. The drive up to the house had been highlighted as an issue but in reality we didn’t find it dramatic. We would and possibly will return without hesitation.
