The house is just beautiful - very comfortable and every tiny detail has been thought out, from fresh flowers, food hamper and essentials in the fridge, to the most delicious home made Parkin made by Paul (he may have also made the Sourdough bread too which was just gorgeous). The underfloor heating downstairs was a real surprise as it was very cold and windy outside, so we were lovely and cosy and there was a constant supply of fuel for the burner too. The bedrooms are gorgeous and the bed linen was beautiful. Would also recommend a hot bath after a cold walk as it was fantastic! Paul and Karen were amazing hosts, so helpful and nothing was too much trouble, they're really lovely people. We'll definitely be back here and would highly recommend Roger Pot to anybody looking for a great getaway in a beautiful location. Thank you so much for such an amazing few days.
