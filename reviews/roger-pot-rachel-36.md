We loved the seclusion and the fields at the back for our dog to run in. We used it as a base to visit both the Lake District (Kendal and Bowness) and the Yorkshire Moores (Malham Cove). The owner was very helpful when required. The house was very well equipped and the welcome pack was a real bonus with the loaf and ginger cake particular highlights. We would definitely stay again.
