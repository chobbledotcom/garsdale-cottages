Everything was really lovely and cosy. Super clean, lovely and warm despite the very wintery weather outside. Shower and bathroom were lovely. We cooked most of our meals in the oven and used the hob and both were easy to use, worked well and with good instructions in the welcome pack. Loved the cute little espresso mugs too. It was a lovely location near Sedbergh, very easy to get to and find surrounded by the beautiful rolling hills. We hope to return.
