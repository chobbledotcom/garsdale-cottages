title: A lovely quirky cottage - immaculately clean and very well equipped.
name: Angela
rating: 5

Particular highlights were generous welcome basket and best of all, and virtually unheard of in holiday accommodation, luxurious bath sheets instead of stupid little towels! And bedding and towels were not the ubiquitous white / hotel like norm….it really felt like a home. Great location - very comfortable - excellent value.
