The pictures do not do the stunning property justice, it is the perfect blend of old cottage and new features. Everything you could want out of a stay, beautiful property set in a picturesque landscape! Loads of walks to do straight from your doorstep. The owners are beyond helpful, answering any and all questions we had. We were welcomed with fresh bread, scones, cheese and much more, the most well-equipped cottage I have ever stayed at. We had the perfect family break & can’t wait to come back. If you’re considering booking this property - do it!
