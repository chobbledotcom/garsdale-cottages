Clean and spacious, warm and comfortable. We stayed for a week and just loved it. Owners live nearby and they welcomed us. On arrival we found dining room and fridge set up with basics (milk, bread, eggs, cake). We also found that the bread and cake were homemade by the owners (really delicious). We enjoyed our stay very much.
