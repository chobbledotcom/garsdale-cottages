Paul and Karen, the owners made us very welcome. Their home made goodies on arrival were such a lovely touch. The house is amazing with spectacular views. It is extremely clean and very comfortable. We loved our stay and we are just about to book again for Spring next year. To anyone thinking of booking please do you will not be disappointed
