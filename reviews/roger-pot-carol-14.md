It is warm and well-appointed, and Paul, who lives next door, was very helpful and friendly. We were there for New Year, and it had been decorated for Chrsitmas which was festive. The beds are very comfortable and there was plenty of hot water, even for a houseful. There is a wood burning stove which we lit every evening - Paul provided extra logs (at cost, after the first basket) and we bought kindling and firelighters. We were a group of 6 adults, 2 toddlers and two dogs and I had worried beforehand that it might feel a bit small. In fact it was fine - the dining table is extendable and we were able to have extra family who were staying nearby over for meals (although they did need to bring their own chairs!). There was one highchair available; we provided our own cots and stairgate. The utility room was ideal for the dogs; there are short walks from the property and lots of longer hikes a short drive away. There is a Spar 15 mins away in Sedbergh, but we took most of our food with us. There is a fairly steep track up to the cottage with three gates to open and close. It snowed whilst we were there and so on Paul's advice we left our cars on the road at the bottom and walked up, which was fine. We loved the seclusion and this was not an issue for us, but may not suit everyone. As many reviews have said, the welcome pack was exceptional, and all in all we had a wonderful time, thank you!
