title: Roger Pot is the nicest cottage we have stayed in.
name: Paul
rating: 5
---

Set in a stunning location with views in three directions the house itself is beautifully kept combining the original features with a modern feel. The appliances are all high quality and to be honest Im not sure how it isn't rated 5 stars. The images really dont do the place full justice, especially the master bedroom which is very spacious with low windows offering the best view there is to have from the cottage. We must mention the welcome from the owners who had provided both fresh flowers and a hamper of basics and local food. Our only gripe would be the Sykes information on the site says there is a pub within a mile which is not the case. The nearest is nearly 5 miles along a country road with no footpath. This slight disappointment aside you really cant fault the property itself. Would thoroughly recommend this property both as a base to explore the dales and lakes or to just unwind in a beautiful, peaceful setting. As a bonus the kids (and adults) will love the sheep and two horses around the site.
