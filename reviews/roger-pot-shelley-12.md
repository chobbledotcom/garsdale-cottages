They made us feel very welcome when we arrived. The house was idyllic, it had everything we needed. We had 2 dogs which settled in very quickly and had a great garden to safely run around. The views are outstanding! Beds are very comfortable and everything is lovely and clean. People in the past have mentioned the lane …. I’m not a confident driver and I really didn’t find it a problem doing it on my own and the gates too. ! Lovely seeing the horses everyday and the sheep are hilarious. We will definitely be returning!
