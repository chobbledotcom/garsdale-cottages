Tranquil and serene with fantastic views from every window made for a totally relaxing week which is exactly what I had hoped for. The welcome pack went above and beyond and the home made bread and parkin cake were unbelievably good, the addition of fresh flowers was also a lovely touch, hope to return in the near future, thanks for a lovely stay.
