Beautiful location, cottage was amazing and great facilities, home from home. A good selection of games to play when the weather wasn't great. Was a nice surprise to find a welcome pack when we arrived, with all the essentials, the homemade parkin was delicious. Would highly recommend, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, although would say very rural so a car is essential.
