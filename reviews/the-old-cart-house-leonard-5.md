The cottage has a wonderful atmosphere, set in a very quiet village and provides a great gateway to the Yorkshire Dales. It is also a great base to explore the Dales, including completing the drive through the Buttertubs pass. It is on the main road but there is very little traffic during the day and next to none during the night, so very quiet.
