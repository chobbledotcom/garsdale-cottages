Cottage was lovely and was exactly what we were looking for. There was a beautiful welcome basked on arrival and the owner has already lit the fire so it was nice a toasty. The cottage has a real cosy feel about it and has all you need for your stay. Beds were really comfy and the kitchen was well equipped. Beautiful views from the cottage and some lovely walks. Due to the bad weather we didn’t really leave the cottage, but there was lots of games to keep us entertained (tv is only very small). Would definitely recommend this cottage.
