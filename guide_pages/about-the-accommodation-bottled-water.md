Whilst the water supply at Roger Pot is treated and tested safe annually it is sourced from a nearby well and therefore cannot realistically be completely guaranteed. We therefore supply bottled water for you to use for drinking and cooking should you wish. Bottled water is stored under the sink and small bottles (with glasses) are also supplied in each of the bathrooms.  Free top-ups are available during your stay if and when required
