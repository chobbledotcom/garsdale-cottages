The address of the property is Roger Pot, Garsdale, Sedbergh, Cumbria, LA10 5PQ

From Sedbergh follow the A684 in the direction of Hawes. Continue for 6 miles, just before you cross the bridge heading into Garsdale, turn in left and there is a metal gate, with the sign 'Roger Pot'. Drive up the track and the house is at the end of the track.  Depending upon your direction of travel the post code slightly overshoots or undershoots the roadside gateway. If you use W3W the gateway can be located at ///pounds.homing.interlude

One of Tthe easiest way to get directions is by using the map, which you can access by [tapping here.](#map) You'll also find the MAP option in the menu at the bottom of your screen. Once on the map you'll see a blue house icon bouncing into position. This is where you are staying. Simply click it and then click "get directions". It will open Google Maps and the end point (where you're staying!) will be filled in. You simply need to type in your starting point.
