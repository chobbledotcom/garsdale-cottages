We welcome pets as per your booking, please respect these following simple requests to keep our home enjoyable for everybody 

Please keep pets off the beds, furniture, and windowsills. If you think your pet is likely to ignore this when you are not looking (!), please bring adequate throws, blankets and sheets to cover up things. Please accept that you as the owner take responsibility for the additional cleaning and sweeping of the living areas that may result from your pet at the end of the stay i.e fouling, chewing and especially moulting. 

 

**Please do keep dogs on leads or under control when walking the public footpaths and fields**. There are sheep and horses surrounding the property

 

If you wish to wash your dog, there is a hosepipe to use with an outside tap and a bucket in the utility meter cupboard.  Please do not wash your dog in the bath as this is acrylic and will scratch.

 

The dog waste goes in the bin and poo bags are provided for this purpose. Perhaps collect them up during your stay and deposit in the bin on departure (please don't bring into the house)

 

**We're sorry but dogs must not be left alone in the property at any time**

 

We work very hard to ensure our property is clean and tidy for your stay. Your co-operation will ensure we have enough time to prepare the cottage for the next guests, and that we can continue to accept dogs without an additional charge.
