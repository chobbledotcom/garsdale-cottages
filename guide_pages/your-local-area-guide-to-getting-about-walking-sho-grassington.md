*8 miles/12.8km | 4.5 hours | moderate*

The countryside around the Yorkshire Dales village of Grassington is dotted with pools and falls, making it an idyllic location for a spot of [wild swimming](https://www.countryfile.com/go-outdoors/get-active/wild-swimming-in-britain-the-best-places-to-swim-water-safety-and-how-to-get-started/). In the meadows south of Grassington, families mess about in rubber dinghies, skip over stepping-stones and throw themselves down water chutes.

Nearby Ghaistrill’s Strid offers exhilarating rapids, while Loup Scar tempts the more intrepid with a high jump and plunge pool. Enjoy all of the above on this riverside ramble along the banks of the Wharfe.
