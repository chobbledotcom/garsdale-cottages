Roger Pot is safe but like any home there are things to be aware of...

- River can be wild during periods of high rain fall. Children should be accompanied at all times

- Horses on site (Silver, Niels and Opal) - they are very friendly but can be boisterous

- Slippery steps in winter (front and back). A supply of salt grit will be available

- The wood burner has an extremely hot stove pipe. Do use the guard (stored behind the sofa) when small people and animals are around. Please don't attempt to dry things on or near the stove
