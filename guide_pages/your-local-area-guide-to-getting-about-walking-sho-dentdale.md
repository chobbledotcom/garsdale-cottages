*2.5 miles/4km | 1.5 hours | easy*

The Yorkshire Dales contains most of Britain’s surviving upland hay meadows, traditionally farmed to allow wildlife to thrive. Dentdale is one of these valleys, divided into a patchwork of idyllic stone-walled fields colourfully blanketed in wildflowers in spring and summer.

Starting from the narrow, cobbled streets of Dent, take time on this walk to look down on species such as meadow buttercup, eyebright and red clover, but also to gaze up at the lofty hills, rising to the highest points in both Yorkshire and Lancashire.
