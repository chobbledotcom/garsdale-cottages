Our three horses Silver, Niels and Opal live in the barn and occupy the four acres surrounding the property. They are managed by the owners who live above them in the upper floor of the barn. The ponies are well-behaved but can be boisterous with each other so try not to get between them if you are saying hello. We prefer you don’t feed them. Opal has a horse diabetes (laminitis) and you will see her grazing with a muzzle to restrict her grass intake. Please shut all gates. There is sometimes an electrical pony tape around the fields. These are generally not electrified unless we are experiencing trouble with one of our horses escaping (one in particular comes to mind!). Rest assured If electrified we will tell you. If we didn’t the worst you would experience is a small shock, but well tell you…honest!
