*6 miles/9.6km | 3.5 hours | moderate*

Yearning for wide open spaces? This wonderful high-level walk meanders past a storied ruin and ends at an attractive waterfall in a little-visited, yet glorious pocket of the Yorkshire Dales.

The walk starts in the little village of [Muker](https://www.countryfile.com/go-outdoors/walks/walk-muker-swaledale-north-yorkshire/) in the heart of Swaledale, a lush green valley with a patchwork of tiny fields and barns. This has never been one of the more popular tourist dales, but our walk takes in the area at its best and most dramatic.
