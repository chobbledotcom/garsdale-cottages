For emergency services (ambulance, police, fire), **call 999**

Do not delay if you feel an emergency situation has arisen. State your location as the address on the front page of this guidebook.

**In case of a fire**

- Exit the property as quickly as possible

- Ensure that all persons are accounted for

Do not attempt to re-enter the building until a Fire Officer states that it is safe to do so.

Fire extinguishers are provided within the property but you should only attempt to extinguish a small fire if you believe it is safe to do so

**In the case of a serious health issue**

Dial 999 for any emergency. The ambulance service will take around 20 minutes to arrive at Roger Pot and then the emergency personnel will walk up the drive to you (Vans are too large for our track). 

If the issue is a non-emergency health matter and you need medical help or advice fast you should call 111. They can also help if you are not sure what action to take.

**Defibrilator - **a defribrilator is positioned on the external wall of the village hall (bottom of the track turn left and it's on the left). Once you arrive at the installation, dial 999 and they will talk you through the process. 

**First Responders** - Garsdale and Sedbergh are covered by a volunteer first responder service. To engage, simply call 999 (or 111 if unsure) and they will send first responders if it's considered suitable 

Notify the property owners at the earliest convenient time of any emergency
