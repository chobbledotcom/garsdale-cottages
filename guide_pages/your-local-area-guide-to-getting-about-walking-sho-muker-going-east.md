*6.8 miles/11km | 4 hours |moderate*

Muker's landscape is largely unchanged from the late-18th and early 19th century, and those iconic features of the Dales – the field barns and the drystone walls – radiate from the village.

Muker is also famous for its species-rich hay meadows. In late spring, these meadows burst into life – a colour bonanza best absorbed after a cup of Yorkshire tea and a slice of cake. This splendid 7-mile circular route starts at Muker and follows the River Swale east to the village of Gunnerside
