Lighting a fire adds a very cosy feel to the house and it warms all the rooms too!

If you've never had to light a fire before simple scrunch up some paper and lay in the bottom of the burner with some kindling and place larger logs on top.  Pull out the stopper button to let the burner breath and light the fire. Once the fire is up and going you can retract the stopper button. Close the doors on the burner at all times. Let the fire burn down to a glow and then reload as required. Dont overload fire. When fully extinguished empty the trays below the burner into the ash bucket and when full give us a shout and we will dispose. Always use the glove provided as it all gets very very hot. The stove pipe is extremely hot and you should avoid touching at all costs. We have provided a fire guard to protect small people and animals from getting around the fire. Please don't attempt to dry clothes or towels on or near the fire. Do take care!
