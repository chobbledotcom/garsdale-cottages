Delicious welcome pack! Clean spacious cottage with all amenities needed, from kitchen utensils to family games! Rural with gorgeous scenery, short drive into Sedbergh for few small shops, pub etc.. slightly further drive into Hawes, more shops, cafes, pubs/restaurants etc... and lovely walks.

**"Just an great place in beautiful surroundings, couldn't wish for more."**

We only had a some discomfort from the midges around the house.

Bloomin midges! Apparently Nationwide problem due to period of wet weather followed by hot period. Ideal for the beasties. Gone now. *Property Owner*

Roger Pot is a great house which has amazing views of the countryside everywhere you look. Felt very relaxed here and thanks to Paul who provided his home made bread and cake in an excellent welcome pack. Would certainly recommend staying here.

Thanks Sue. Further to quick chat I understand your info issue was to do with the rather rustic farm track up to our house. Obviously fully accessible, many small vans, non 4x4’s, low profile cars, horse box trailers and tractors use the route up but appreciate it’s useful to know *Property Owner*

**"Great location with wonderful views and beautiful house."**

Friendly and helpful owners who provided the best welcome hamper ever!

Response - Okay following our comms understand 75%’s boiled down to some dog hairs and smell on some rugs (extra effort on cleaning required Paul!!), some suggestions on extra knives/pots for the kitchen ( duly noted and actioned) and some tired garden seats (actioned straight away- new seats installed). Feedback truly always welcome *Property Owner*

**"What a beautiful place Roger Pot is with fabulous hosting from Paul and Karen."**

Warm welcome with the wood burner lit and an exceptional welcome pack. Cannot fault. We have an anxious mutt who is wary of large dogs and strangers but the hosts were understanding of this and ensured their (very friendly!) pooch was kept away from him. This made for a relaxing stay and for this we are grateful. The cottage is well equipped and very comfortable-slept really well! Location great for exploring the Dales and Lake District. All in all we had a lovely week- thank you!

**"Absolutely stunning property, we couldn't fault anything at all."**

The house is just beautiful - very comfortable and every tiny detail has been thought out, from fresh flowers, food hamper and essentials in the fridge, to the most delicious home made Parkin made by Paul (he may have also made the Sourdough bread too which was just gorgeous). The underfloor heating downstairs was a real surprise as it was very cold and windy outside, so we were lovely and cosy and there was a constant supply of fuel for the burner too. The bedrooms are gorgeous and the bed linen was beautiful. Would also recommend a hot bath after a cold walk as it was fantastic! Paul and Karen were amazing hosts, so helpful and nothing was too much trouble, they're really lovely people. We'll definitely be back here and would highly recommend Roger Pot to anybody looking for a great getaway in a beautiful location. Thank you so much for such an amazing few days.

**"We stayed at the Roger Pot over New Year."**

Cottage was lovely and was exactly what we were looking for. There was a beautiful welcome basked on arrival and the owner has already lit the fire so it was nice a toasty. The cottage has a real cosy feel about it and has all you need for your stay. Beds were really comfy and the kitchen was well equipped. Beautiful views from the cottage and some lovely walks. Due to the bad weather we didn’t really leave the cottage, but there was lots of games to keep us entertained (tv is only very small). Would definitely recommend this cottage.

**"We all really loved our stay over Christmas."**

We all felt at home as soon as we stepped through the door. Credit to the owners, who put real effort into decorating for Christmas and ensuring that we had everything we needed, including fuel for the fire. This house is beautiful. It has a warm, welcoming, cosy feeling to it with a truly huge view across the valley. We could not have asked for more. It might be worth mentioning that the house is accessed via a narrow steep track with quite a steep drop to the river on one side, so you need to be a confident driver to negotiate it (my other half wouldn’t drive whilst we were here)

**"Lovely cottage in a beautiful setting."**

We loved the seclusion and the fields at the back for our dog to run in. We used it as a base to visit both the Lake District (Kendal and Bowness) and the Yorkshire Moors (Malham Cove). The owner was very helpful when required. The house was very well equipped and the welcome pack was a real bonus with the loaf and ginger cake particular highlights. We would definitely stay again.

**"Beautiful cottage with stunning views."**

Clean and spacious, warm and comfortable. We stayed for a week and just loved it. Owners live nearby and they welcomed us. On arrival we found dining room and fridge set up with basics (milk, bread, eggs, cake). We also found that the bread and cake were homemade by the owners (really delicious). We enjoyed our stay very much.

It was very well equipped and had absolutely everything we needed. The welcome hamper was a lovely touch. The property was clean and so comfortable to spend the whole day in, when the weather took a turn. Garsdale is well positioned for visits to the Lake District or the Yorkshire Dales.

**"Roger Pot is the nicest cottage we have stayed in."**

Set in a stunning location with views in three directions the house itself is beautifully kept combining the original features with a modern feel. The appliances are all high quality and to be honest I’m not sure how it isn't rated 5 stars. The images really don’t do the place full justice, especially the master bedroom which is very spacious with low windows offering the best view there is to have from the cottage. We must mention the welcome from the owners who had provided both fresh flowers and a hamper of basics and local food. Our only gripe would be the Sykes information on the site says there is a pub within a mile which is not the case. The nearest is nearly 5 miles along a country road with no footpath. This slight disappointment aside you really can’t fault the property itself. Would thoroughly recommend this property both as a base to explore the dales and lakes or to just unwind in a beautiful, peaceful setting. As a bonus the kids (and adults) will love the sheep and two horses around the site.

Response - Thanks for the kind review Paul. We’ve put right the error regarding the pub. Thanks for pointing that out. *Property Owner*

Beautiful location, cottage was amazing and great facilities, home from home. A good selection of games to play when the weather wasn't great. Was a nice surprise to find a welcome pack when we arrived, with all the essentials, the homemade parkin was delicious. Would highly recommend, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, although would say very rural so a car is essential.
