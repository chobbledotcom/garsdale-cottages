**The Little White Bus:** the Garsdale Station Shuttle bus (between Gasdale Head Station and Hawes) provides a scheduled service to meet trains at 12.07, 12.22, 14.40 and 14.50. There is no need to book if you are arriving or departing on these trains. The Little White Bus runs trips to local places of interest throughout the year and can be booked to drop off or collect specific parties from and to Garsdale for a modest fee (note this doesnt come down to the village)

**Stagecoach** run a daily service to Penrith setting off from opposite Sedbergh library at 9am. This service goes through Kerby Stephen and various small villages before arriving in Penrith. A very scenic route and ideal for a big shopping trip too! Details and timetables will be upload here soon but can viewed on-line or in the Sedbergh library window

**Garsdale village services** – it is understood that a call response service is available from the Little White Bus – details to follow
