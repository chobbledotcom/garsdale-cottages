**LPG heating** – The LPG boiler is no longer in use. The bolier should not be touched please

**Lounge log fire heating and hot water** – the multifuel burner has a back boiler which heats water circulating through the house. If the fire is lit it will automatically heat the hot water and heat the house through underfloor heating on the ground floor and the panel radiators on the first floor. We will provide a basket of logs on arrival. Top-ups are available at a cost of £10/basket (top ups are free in the winter)

**Panel electric radiators** - We have transitioned to all electric for heating and you will see panel radiators in each of the rooms. The are set to a comfort temp of 18 degrees.  The LPG panels remain and will operate when the lounge fire is operating (adjust their temp individually in the usual way via the TRV). Please do not attempt to dry clothes on or too near to the panel radiators as this potentially may cause a fire hazard
