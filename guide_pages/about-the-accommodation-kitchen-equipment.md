All devices should be fairly straightforward to use. Paper copies of the instruction manuals are stored in the drawer under the microwave. For web copies please go to [https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmXhwTQEY9NjhKtkHrusrs8dVzxtZw?e=j1RK5x](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmXhwTQEY9NjhKtkHrusrs8dVzxtZw?e=j1RK5x). Here are some specifics you might want to know:

The dishwasher: we have left you some dishwasher tablets in the cupboard under the sink

The hob and oven: the oven is all electric. It has an induction hob which means only the induction friendly types of metal pots and pans will operate 

Extract fan: Please note that this doesn't come on automatically with the light. The switch is behind the toaster. Please do remember to switch off when finished in the kitchen
