**Lounge TV**

There is a manual for the LV TV, but I know you probably won’t want to read it, but here is a quick start guide. Turn on TV and it will take you to the home page. If it doesn't just press 'house' picture on controller where you will then see some adverts for programmes and a row of TV for you to select from. This will work for BBC, ITV and Channel 4 and channel. All other Apps you have to sign in using your private subscription details. If the App you require is not on the home screen simply click on the App icon and select the App you require

**Bedroom 1 TV**

The TV in Bed 1 has a Roku device only which will allow you to watch your own subscription channels and also catch up on free channels, BBC, All Four, Channel 5, Sky News, and a few others.  Once you have switched on the TV please refer to Roku TV guide below

 

**Roku TV**

A Roko device is attached to the Bed 1 TV set at Roger Pot

Rather than give you a large manual I have the following information which you may find useful

When you turn on the TV it will take you to a guest page.  You enter the date of your departure and it will take you to the home screen.  All your settings and passwords will be automatically deleted from the Ruko on the day you depart or you can go into settings from the home page and click on guest, Delete guest and it will delete all your settings

When you first go into the home page you will see that there are apps already downloaded for use of your own subscriptions.  You can find more apps relevant to your subscriptions in the home page, Apps.  You can then download your selection, sign in and watch as you would on your normal tv or laptop etc

Instructions on how to use the remote are attached but you can also download the Ruko Remote app from an app store (i.e. Google App) which will allow you to listen to the TV via your mobile with headphones and voice control

For Apple devices there is an app obtainable from the Home page, Apps, that you can download to use your Apple phone which you may find useful

All other manuals can be found in the kitchen drawer under the microwave
