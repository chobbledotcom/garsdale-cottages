The bins are located at the main road gate. We would suggest simply leaving your bagged rubbish outside the front door on departure or take it to the roadside bins if convenient. No loose rubbish should be placed in any of the bins. Please always use rubbish bags. Extra rubbish bags can be located at the bottom of the in-house bins

We are required to recycle our waste into three categories; general waste, recyled plastic and tin and lastly glass
