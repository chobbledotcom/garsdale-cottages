Historically, Garsdale was a chapelry in the ancient parish of Sedbergh in the Ewecross wapentake in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1866 it became a separate civil parish. From 1894 to 1974 it was part of Sedbergh Rural District. In 1974 it became part of the new county of Cumbria. In the 2001 census the parish had a population of 202 decreasing at the 2011 census to 191. Garsdale is on the western slopes of the Pennines, between Baugh Fell to the north, and Rise Hill to the south. It is within the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The dale is the valley of the Clough River, which rises on the north eastern slopes of Baugh Fell and flows through Grisedale, the Dale that Died, as Grisedale Beck until it becomes the Clough River at Garsdale Head.
