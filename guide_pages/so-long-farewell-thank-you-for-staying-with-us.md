**Thank you for staying with us, and we hope you enjoyed your stay.**

If there were any issues with your stay, please don't hesitate to tell us, as we want to ensure we can resolve them for the next guest. 

**We love online reviews!** 

If you decide to leave a review please give us a star rating, and write a sentence or two about what you liked the best during your stay. 

Was it the comfy bed? The detailed information and local recommendations? Or maybe the location itself? 

If you are unable to leave us 5 stars, please don't hesitate to contact us first to let us know why - you are key to helping us improve. We take all feedback onboard. 

**Thank you!**
