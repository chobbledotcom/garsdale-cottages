*10.2 miles/16.5km | 6 hours |moderate*

On a lonely site high in the Yorkshire Dales stands a unique and historic place. With its exposed beams, stone-flagged floor and welcoming fire, the Tan Hill Inn, Britain’s highest public house at 528m (1,732ft), is a place where walkers brush shoulders with inquisitive tourists.

This walk takes you from Keld to the head of Arkengarthdale on the edge of Swaledale, where winds rush across moorland, and where you can stop at the warm pub to refuel or rest your weary head.
