**Cars **– parking is limited on the site so please try to be mindful, as we will be, to allow space for other to manoeuvre for entry and exit. You will have also experienced the track up to the house so again please be mindful that there are no turning places should you meet someone coming up or going down. Preferably please text one of the numbers on the gate each time you drive up, we will do the same. Reversing is possible but not preferable!  Avoid also texting when you’re coming down as this will just confuse. 

**EV charging - **If you have an electric car we are happy for you to charge it with your own extension lead. We only ask that you tell us in advance, take a meter reading before and after charging so we can record your upload. We will only charge for your use at the rates we pay
