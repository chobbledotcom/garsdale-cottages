---

Sedbergh 6.4 miles.

The Old Cart House, a delightful detached stone property with a rich history as a former cart house, offers breath-taking countryside views, nestled in the picturesque rural hamlet of Garsdale, Cumbria.

This charming retreat is perfectly suited for couples, solo travellers, or small families eager to discover the natural splendour of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.

With convenient roadside parking and a welcoming ambience, it’s an ideal base for your next countryside escape.

Step into a delightful open-plan living space brimming with character, where exposed wooden beams and vaulted ceilings create a warm and inviting atmosphere.

Sink into the seating, perfectly positioned in front of the coal effect fire, making it an idyllic spot to enjoy a coffee while planning your day’s adventures.

When it’s time to prepare a meal, the quaint yet well-equipped kitchen area beckons, cleverly designed with amenities neatly tucked under the staircase, including a washing machine for added convenience during longer stays.

Dine at the intimate table set for two, or, if the weather is kind, take your culinary creations outside and enjoy an alfresco meal.

Climb the timber staircase to discover a charming window seat, the perfect nook for soaking in the breath-taking countryside views in peaceful solitude.

The light and airy king-size bedroom awaits, offering a tranquil retreat adorned with rustic exposed wood and a re-claimed stable door that opens to a contemporary en-suite shower room.

Here, you can refresh under the sleek shower before slipping into your pyjamas and sinking into the sumptuous bed to catch your rest.

Explore the breath-taking landscapes of the Yorkshire Dales National Park right from your doorstep, with popular trails like the Pennine Bridleway and Dales Way nearby.

Don't forget to bring your camera, where you might spot red squirrels darting through the trees, graceful roe deer grazing in the meadows, and a variety of bird species.

A short drive will take you to Sedbergh, where you can wander through many independent bookshops, or perhaps visit Farfield Mill with its local art, crafts, and heritage at this restored Victorian woollen mill.

Stock up on the essentials at one of the convenience stores for some home-cooking, before savouring a refreshing pint at The Red Lion.

For those keen on hiking, a short trek leads to the breath-taking Cotter Force in Hardraw, a serene waterfall where you can unwind and take in the beauty of nature, especially after conquering the trails around Great Shunner Fell.

This serene market town is well-worth a visit, with its artisan shops and traditional pubs.

The Lake District National Park is also within reach, where you can explore some of the iconic lakes, offering a chance to explore landmarks like Windermere and Coniston Water.

Whether you’re an outdoor enthusiast, history buff, or seeking relaxation in a serene setting, The Old Cart House offers something for everyone.

The property is approx 9 miles from Hawes and 17 miles from Kendal.
