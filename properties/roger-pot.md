meta_description: "Roger Pot - A beautiful, detached house resting in the countryside of Garsdale near Sedbergh, Cumbria. Pet-friendly. Countryside views. Woodburning stove. "
---

Sedbergh 6.3 miles.

Boasting incredible countryside views, Roger Pot is a fantastic stone-built property with ample off-road parking and a garden, nestled into the rural hamlet of Garsdale near Sedbergh; the property is ideal for friends or families looking to explore Cumbria.

Roger Pot is located in a fantastic off road location some quarter of a mile up a traditional rustic farm track.

Park off-road and be welcomed into a charming sitting room with exposed stone, wooden roof beams and ample furniture nestled before a woodburning stove, a lovely space to relax in with a coffee as you plan the day ahead of you.

When mealtimes call, the beautifully presented kitchen welcomes you to cook up a storm using the ample amenities, which are hidden neatly into contemporary furniture.

Here there is a lovely exposed stone shelf adding character, and a lovely dining room where guests can enjoy a hearty meal, whilst the handy utility takes care of all of your muddy clothes.

Ascend the stairs to find a spacious and airy family bathroom where guests can enjoy a soak amongst the bubbles or a refreshing shower, and here you will also find three bedrooms.

Choose between a double with storage, a twin zip/link that can be set up as a super-king-size on request, with the added feature of a window seat, and finally a beautiful master bedroom, spacious with a king-size bed, wooden roofbeams and an en-suite.

Outside, make the most of the fresh air and countryside views by dining alfresco, with the chance to spot some of the resident red squirrels, or travel through the 4-acres of land surrounding the property, to fish in the nearby river.

Garsdale is a rural hamlet resting beside the Clough River, with beautiful countryside framing the village.

To stock up on amenities or to have a tipple and a hot meal, head over to the village of Sedbergh where there is a local shop, eateries and a pub, as well as a golf course where you can try out a game or two, whilst Hawes, a wonderful town is a must-visit, with plenty of shops, welcoming pubs, a fish and chip shop, and the Wensleydale Cheese Factory, offering guided tours and an on-site shop.

There are more tasty eateries and independent shops at Kendal which you can browse at your leisure.

From here, enjoy the scenery of the Yorkshire Dales at Hardraw Force Waterfall, Gastack Beck Waterfall, and Ribblehead Viaduct, or many of the other incredible sites, or learn more about the local history and heritage at Dales Countryside Museum.

For a day at the coast visit Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty or venture into the Lake District National Park, where there is an abundance of incredible trails and watersports activities, whilst steam train spotters will enjoy visiting Garsdale train station, running along the Carlisle and Leeds line via Settle.

All of this and so much more with a stay at the charming Roger Pot.
